# Usage
## Running shell
Execute this command
```sh
shpy.bat # on windows
shpy # on linux
```
or embed this command as your default shell

Note - this file will be on the default python scripts folder, considure adding this folder to PATH

## Using the shell
In the shell itself, just write your commands

If the command has no python-meaning, we will try to run it in shell context.

If you want the shell to force-run command in shell context, execute
```python
command("<insert command here>")
```
within the shell
